1. **Movement Control** - Receives and executes movement commands.
2. **Telemetry Transmission** - Sends rover status data.
3. **Temperature Data Logging** - Transfers temperature readings to Earth.
4. **Error Simulation** - Enables fault testing and diagnostics.
5. **Rover Discovery** - Searches for nearby rovers to establish connections.
