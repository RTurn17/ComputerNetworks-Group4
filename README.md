# 🌕 Lunar Rover Communication Protocol
Computer Networks Project - Group 4

## Overview
This project implements a communication protocol between a lunar rover and Earth, utilizing **5 ports**, each dedicated to a specific interaction:

1. **Movement** - Controls the rover's movement commands.
2. **Telemetry** - Retrieves rover status data.
3. **Temperature Data File** - Transfers temperature readings.
4. **Error Simulation** - Tests fault tolerance and error handling.
5. **Rover Discovery** - Discovers nearby rovers for potential collaboration.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Port Communication** 🛰️
- **Error Handling & Simulation** ⚠️
- **Real-Time Data Exchange** 📡
- **Rover-to-Rover Discovery** 🔍
- **Secure Protocol for Reliable Transmission with Authentification features** 🔒

🌑 Built for lunar exploration and beyond! 🚀
